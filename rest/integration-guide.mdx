<Warning>
  This API must be used in the backend.
  You do not want to use your API Key on the frontend since it can be stolen there.
</Warning>

## Session Initialization

-
  [Create a session](/api-reference/endpoint/create-session) using your `API Key` and receive a session `token`.
  Think of sessions like meeting rooms with avatars.
  You can connect to such a room and control what an avatar says.
-
  Send received session `token` to frontend and use [Web SDK](/web-sdk).
-
  If you want to control what the avatar is saying from the backend,
  [Request the avatar to say something](/api-reference/endpoint/request-speech).
  Nothing is said until you connect to the room (or while you're disconnected).
-
  [Terminate the session](/api-reference/endpoint/terminate-session).
  A session is terminated automatically after N [SET THE NUMBER] minutes of inactivity.
