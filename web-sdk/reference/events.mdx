The SDK provides various events related to the avatar's operations, allowing you to track its state and actions. You can use these events with the `on()` and `off()` methods to subscribe to and manage interactions with the avatar.

#### Avatar speech events

These events track the start and end of the avatar's speech, as well as specific phrases it speaks.

- **`avatar_started_speaking`**  
  This event is triggered when the avatar begins speaking.  

- **`avatar_ended_speaking`**  
  This event is triggered when the avatar finishes speaking.  

- **`avatar_started_speaking_phrase`**  
  This event is triggered when the avatar starts speaking a specific phrase.  
  **Callback data**:  
  ```javascript
  {
    phrase_id: string;  // Unique identifier of the phrase
    type: "avatar_started_speaking_phrase";
  }
  ```

- **`avatar_ended_speaking_phrase`**  
  This event is triggered when the avatar finishes speaking a phrase.  
  **Callback data**:  
  ```javascript
  {
    phrase_id: string;  // Unique identifier of the phrase
    type: "avatar_ended_speaking_phrase";
  }
  ```

#### SDK events

These events manage the session state and avatar activity.

- **`init`**  
  Triggered when the avatar is initialized and the session is successfully started.  
  Does not pass additional data to the callback.

- **`task`**  
  Triggered when the avatar starts performing a task, such as speaking text via the [task()](/web-sdk/reference/methods#task) method.  
  Does not pass additional data to the callback.

- **`dispose`**  
  Triggered when the avatar session ends or the avatar is disposed of.  
  Does not pass additional data to the callback.

- **`idle`**  
  Triggered when the avatar goes into an idle or inactive state.  
  Does not pass additional data to the callback.

### Example Usage

Hereâ€™s an example of using the events with `on()` and `off()` methods:

```javascript
function handlePhraseEnd(data) {
  console.log('Avatar ended phrase with ID:', data.phrase_id);
}

sdk.on('avatar_ended_speaking_phrase', handlePhraseEnd);

// additional code...

sdk.off('avatar_ended_speaking_phrase', handlePhraseEnd);
```
