## Step 1: Install Dependencies

Install the SDK.

```bash
npm install @avaturn-live/web-sdk
```

## Step 2: Initialize

Create an instance of the `AvaturnHead` class and initialize it with an optional configuration.  
You need to pass a session token obtained from [this endpoint](ref:create_session_v1_session_create_post) (**it must be used in the backend**).  

Make sure to correctly pass a reference to the DOM element (`domElement`) depending on your framework (e.g., use `ref` in React or Vue, `@ViewChild` in Angular, etc.).

```typescript
import { AvaturnHead } from "./AvaturnHead";

const domElement = document.querySelector("#avaturn-video");

const avaturnHead = new AvaturnHead(domElement, { sessionToken: "[session token obtained from backend]" });
await avaturnHead.init();
```

## Step 3: Send Tasks

Use the `task` method to send speech requests. If the avatar is already speaking, the text fragment is queued to be spoken at a later time. Nothing is said while you're disconnected.

```typescript
const response = await avaturnHead.task("Some text to say");
console.log(response);
```

## Step 4: Subscribe to Events

Register event listeners to handle specific events during the session.

```typescript
avaturnHead.on("avatar_started_speaking", (data) => {
  console.log("Avatar started speaking:", data);
});
```

If you no longer need to listen to an event, you can remove the event listener.

```typescript
avaturnHead.off("avatar_started_speaking", callback);
```

## Step 6: Dispose

When you are done with the session, make sure to call the `dispose` method to clean up resources.

```typescript
avaturnHead.dispose();
```
