## Overview

This API allows you to create and delete sessions.
We expect you to use our [Web SDK](/web-sdk) to control avatar speech from frontend.
However you can use this API to control avatar speech from your backend as well.

## Authorization

Uou need to provide the `Bearer` header, which can be obtained in the dashboard.
`API Key` **must be used in the backend** and never in the frontend.

<Warning>
  Keep the API Key secret and safe.
  Anyone with access to your API Key can make API requests on your behalf.
  If you suspect that your token has been compromised, you should immediately revoke the token in the dashboard.
</Warning>
