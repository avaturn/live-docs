1. Use streaming endpoint of the LLM of your choice.
2. Split text stream into stream of sentences. Similar approach is described [here](https://elevenlabs.io/docs/api-reference/websockets#example-voice-streaming-using-elevenlabs-and-openai).
3. Send the sentences one by one to Avaturn.Live [endpoint](/api-reference/endpoint/request-speech).
