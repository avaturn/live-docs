## Overview

We expect you to work with API in the following way:
1. You [create a session](/rest) on your backend and send a session token to the frontend.
2. You use our [Web SDK](/web-sdk) there to control the avatar speech.
3. You terminate a session in the backend if needed. The session will be automatically terminated when user leaves.

The current recommended approach to the integration is to use [OpenAI Realtime conversation engine](/howtos/openai_realtime_api).
